I've felt your presence, little spirit, as you ascended this monument.
Your attunement is very close to ours, but... different. Still grounded.
This chance you've been given is an unimaginable gift.
The struggle, the curse...
It could all still fade away, like an eternal frost beneath the glory of the sun.
You've found a way.
