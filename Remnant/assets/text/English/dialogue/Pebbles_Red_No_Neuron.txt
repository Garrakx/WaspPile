40 : 10 : They were wrong, weren't they.
The overseers were persistent in following you. Yet I see nothing of value here.
Reports indicated you had a payload. Where is it?
10 : 70 : ...
Were they wrong? Did you lose it?
And despite your unusual nature, you are as silent as the lowest of beasts.
Why are you even here, specter?<LINE>Did you decide to take a stroll in this unstable shell out of sheer boredom?
So much effort and anticipation - all for nothing. Next time I will not bother.
You may continue your tour as you wish.
Get out.
