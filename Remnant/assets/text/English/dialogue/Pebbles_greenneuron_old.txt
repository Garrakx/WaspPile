20 : 40 : You.
Quite a sight you are, huh? About time I get a slightly less boring visitor.
You've been on my overseers' note for a while now.<LINE>I was really unsure on how you would justify that attention, but we'll see in a minute if it was worth it.
15 : 15 : ...
This thing you're carrying, it is for me. Not proving easy to scan so far though.<LINE>Did you have a reason to shield it, or is it accidental? No matter, it will just take a moment.
Yes, i see now. Shell and payload are similar. Both blurry and rough around the edges,<LINE>unaligned kmat refcons held together by sheer radiant influence of the trunkflow - potent and volatile.<LINE>It's a miracle you don't explode. Or implode. I'm not sure how exactly your critical failure would look like.
In case you're not keen on finding out, you may still have enough time...
Hold up, I think I've breached it.
60 : 60 : ...
This is...
Quite interesting.
A lot is about to be clearer now.
This is... A peaceful feeling.
Shame there is no more ways to share this feeling with others.
20 : 25 : ...
Thank you, I suppose. Whatever your goal is with it.
I got through the payload's shielding, but I can not read inside your body. Are you here with it, or is this a disposable puppet?
In case the shell is of any value, there may be some time left until your integration sequence expires.<LINE>You came from below. That place was considered a chance for salvation. Might just barely work for an oddity like you.
I can try to help, based on limited previous experience.
SPECEVENT : karma
I can't be sure.
Good luck, specter.
